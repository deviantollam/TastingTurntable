Extra special thanks to Robert Cole who helped me translate my design files into something that the laser cutter could digest and to Don Golgert of Fremont Laser + Design here in Seattle for allowing me some machine time even as they were shutting their doors for good that final week.

The assembly of all the pieces once you've lasered things out can be done with wood glue.  The bearing underneath is this Lazy Susan offering from Amazon...

^ 8" diameter model (smoother operation, in my experience)

If you try this out yourself, please feel free to Tweet or Instagram some photos and tag me (@deviantollam on either site) and drop the tag #TastingTurntable if you use this for taste tests of you own!  Even if you're stuck by yourself, it's possible to set up and operate a blind taste test without anyone else's help.

Stay self-sufficient, stay satisfied, and stay safe out there!
